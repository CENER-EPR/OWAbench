Background 
=========================
The `OWA Wake Modeling Challenge <https://www.carbontrust.com/media/677495/owa-wake-modelling-challenge_final-feb27.pdf>`_ is an Offshore Wind Accelerator (OWA) project that aims to improve confidence in wake models in the prediction of array efficiency. A benchmarking process comprising 5 wind farms allows wake model developers and end-users test their array efficiency prediction methodologies over a wide range of wind climate and wind farm layout conditions.

The project is integrated in the Phase 3 of the `IEA Task 31 Wakebench <https://community.ieawind.org/task31/home>`_ international framework for wind farm modeling and evaluation.

Scope and Objectives
====================
The primary objective of the project is to understand the limitations of wake models used by industry for the prediction of array efficiency over a relevant range of operational conditions in the offshore environment. To this end, the following three objectives were defined to guide the Wake Modelling Challenge:

* Evaluate wake modelling and power prediction methods and validate the results with measured data.
* Examine the accuracy of specific models, quantify uncertainty bands and highlight modelling trends.
* Define an open-access model evaluation methodology that can systematically improve consistency and traceability in the assessment of state-of-the-art wake models for power prediction as more datasets are added.

Benchmark Guides
================
The following blog posts were used to guide benchmark participants:
* `Anholt benchmark <https://thewindvaneblog.com/the-owa-anholt-array-efficiency-benchmark-436fc538597d>`_  
* `5 additional offshore wind farms <https://thewindvaneblog.com/owa-wake-modelling-challenge-extended-to-6-offshore-wind-farms-c76d1ae645c2>`_  

Data
====================
Benchmark input data and simulation data is published open-access in the following data repository:
