Background 
=========================
The `OWA Wake Modeling Challenge <https://www.carbontrust.com/media/677495/owa-wake-modelling-challenge_final-feb27.pdf>`_ is an Offshore Wind Accelerator (OWA) project that aims to improve confidence in wake models in the prediction of array efficiency. A benchmarking process comprising several wind farms will allow model developers and end-users test their array efficiency prediction methodologies over a wide range of wind climate and wind farm layout conditions.

The project is integrated in the `IEA Task 31 Wakebench <https://community.ieawind.org/task31/home>`_ international framework for wind farm modeling and evaluation.

Scope and Objectives
====================
The `Anholt benchmark <https://thewindvaneblog.com/the-owa-anholt-array-efficiency-benchmark-436fc538597d>`_ is a pilot to define, together with the participants, an open-source model evaluation methodology for array efficiency prediction. The benchmark is set up as a blind test so you wonâ€™t be able to access observational data. Instead, mesoscale simulation data is available for the modeller to decide on the best interpretation of the input data for the specific needs of the wake model. Participants will be able to test the evaluation scripts, based on Jupyter notebooks, on own simulation data and submit their best prediction. 

This github repository hosts the model evaluation scripts that will be used throughout the OWA benchmarking project.
